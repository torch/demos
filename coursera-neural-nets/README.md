## Neural Networks for Machine Learning (Coursera)
First two assignments from the [Coursera Neural Networks class](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets) converted from Matlab to Torch7.

### Installation
- [gfx.js](https://github.com/clementfarabet/gfx.js) for graphs.
- [matio](https://github.com/soumith/matio-ffi.torch) for loading matlab data files without having matlab installed. 

Make sure gfx.js is running for running Assignment 1.

``` sh
 luajit -lgfx.start
```
